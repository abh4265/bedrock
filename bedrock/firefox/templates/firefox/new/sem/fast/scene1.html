    The new multi-process Firefox is faster and uses less memory than Chrome, so you can browse smoothly and leave plenty of memory to keep your computer snappy.

  <h3>More Browser Speed</h3>

  <p>
    Bring it, Internet! We’ve spent the last year supercharging Firefox’s performance. Now start up faster, tab hop quicker, and scroll like a speed demon.

  <h3>More Browser Privacy</h3>

  <p>
    Firefox doesn’t sell access to your personal information like other companies. From privacy tools to tracking protection, you’re in charge of who sees what.

  <h3>More Browser Freedom</h3>

  <p>
    Following the pack isn’t our style. As part of the non-profit Mozilla, Firefox leads the fight to protect your online rights, and champion an Internet that benefits everyone—not just a few.
